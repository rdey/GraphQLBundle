Solving N+1 Problem
====================

As explained in [GraphQL-PHP documentation](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php/blob/master/docs/data-fetching.md),
solving N+1 Problem can be a requirement to make your application production ready.
For that reason, we also provide a bundle [redeye/dataloader-bundle](https://github.com/redeye/dataloader-bundle)
based on [facebook dataloader](https://github.com/facebook/dataloader) answering easily to this need.
